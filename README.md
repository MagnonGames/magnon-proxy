# Magnon Proxy
This repository is what we use for our proxy on our server. Most likely, this isn't
what you're interested in, but instead you would like to have a look at our [complete
website](https://github.com/theMagnon/magnon.net).

## Note about nginx.tmpl
You should source the nginx.tmpl by yourself. You can find it [here](https://github.com/jwilder/nginx-proxy/blob/master/nginx.tmpl).
